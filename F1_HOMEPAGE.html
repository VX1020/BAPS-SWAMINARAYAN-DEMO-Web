		 <font size="4"> A rare soul who always lived for others and at the same time remained totally absorbed in God. A peaceful, humble, simple and spiritual personality - this is Pramukh Swami Maharaj.</font></p>
		
		<p>
		<font size="4" face="Arial Unicode MS">This great guru, the fifth spiritual successor in Bhagwan Swaminarayan's succession of Gunatit gurus, was born in a farme's family on 7 December 1921, in the village of Chansad, located near Vadodara. His childhood name was Shantilal. And true to his name, peace was the introduction to his personality. From his childhood, his inclination was to perform spiritual austerities in the Himalayas. However, during his adolescent years, he was attracted to the pure life of Brahmaswarup Shastriji Maharaj, Bhagwan Swaminarayan's third spiritual successor. After completing his initial studies at the age of 18, he renounced the world and was initiated by Shastriji Maharaj in 1940, and renamed Narayanswarupdas Swami. His striking humility, noble services, saintliness and selfless desire to help all, won him the love of everyone. In 1950, when he was only 28 years old, Shastriji Maharaj appointed him as the president of BAPS. From then on, he affectionately became known as 'Pramukh Swami'

		<p>
		<font size="4" face="Arial Unicode MS">Shastriji Maharaj passed away in 1951, declaring Yogiji Maharaj as his spiritual successor. Thereafter, Pramukh Swami served under the guidance and blessings of Yogiji Maharaj. In 1971, he became the spiritual successor of Brahmaswarup Yogiji Maharaj and his life has continued to be an inspiration to countless people, guiding them all to lead a spiritual life. "In the joy of others lies our ow..." This maxim by Pramukh Swami Maharaj is not only an inspiring call for all of humanity, but also reflects the spirit of his humanitarian services to humankind and society.
